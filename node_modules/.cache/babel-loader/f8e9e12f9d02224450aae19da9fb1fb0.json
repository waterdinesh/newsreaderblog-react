I was driving my Honda Sedan and Subhrita, my Assistant Professor, was sitting in the front passenger seat. It was about 6.15 pm and the sun was already setting; its orange glow lighting up the far end of the sky; the birds were flying away in a flock.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the way back, there was a long stretch of dense forest, quite a few kilometers I would presume. At that time the road was passing through the unbroken wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the drive was long and arduous, I felt like taking a break. Pulling to the side and switching off the engine I looked at Subhrita, “Can I have a cup of coffee from the flask?“ She nodded and picked up the flask from the rear seat.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile sipping the coffee, I switched on the radio in the car tuning into the local FM band. A popular song started playing. I was feeling momentarily relaxed. Subhrita was gazing out of the window from her side – thick green forest was around us appearing to engulf us.\\r\\n\\r\\nTime passed. The home bound birds were chirping but umpteen forest noises were increasingly becoming more audible; many parts of the flora were getting covered in the shadows due to gradual oncoming of darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoffee over, I was about to start the car when suddenly the song on the radio died away; must be some signal problem; silence descended … followed by noise of radio static… and then a blood curdling scream… so horrific that my senses dulled for a moment – the hair on my neck started bristling; a man’s voice floated in indistinctly, “Help… somebody help….I am dying…” It ended with a gurgling noise as if the man had been strangulated. Abruptly thereafter there was complete silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon the music restarted as if there was no interruption.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stared at the radio and then turned towards Subhrita, “What was that?” My face showed a mixture of surprise and apprehension.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe frowned, “I don’t know…something very eerie, somebody seems to be in trouble, but how can that voice come through the radio? Let’s go home fast.” She looked away appearing nervous; it was natural.\\r\\n\\r\\nI leaned forward and fiddled with the radio; everything appeared normal. Could it be some type of advertisement or radio play or it might be a cross radio channel? I scratched my head. What should I do?\\r\\n\\r\\nThat incident passed without any further occurrence and we returned home about an hour later; by which time darkness had fallen.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would not have thought about the strange experience any further but for another incident which happened about a week later. I was alone in my car that day traveling on the same highway, nearing the identical place, the only difference was the time ; it was early afternoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomehow my sixth sense was hinting that something will not be right. And that happened. This time exactly similar ghostly phenomenon occurred with the voice trailing, “…….I am dying… ,” followed by a gurgling noise.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stopped the car. The daylight of a sunny afternoon made me more bold and besides a repetition had ensured that it was not a sudden shock.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther vehicles were plying on the road. I alighted from the car and looked around. I was not sure what I intended to do except that I felt that the mystery would be solved here.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had parked the car on the left side of the road, so it was instinctive that I looked at the forest at that side. Gradually I started walking inside. Due to the heavy vegetation a few steps inside drastically curtailed the brightness of the sun and a peculiar smell hit my nose. With whatever dim light which was percolating through the leaves and branches I saw the ground and found that it was covered with fallen leaves at various places; strewn around.\\r\\n\\r\\nA portion of the open ground a little away on my right, caught my eyes. It looked as if it was dug up and then covered in haste. The area was relatively clear as compared to the adjoining areas. I went forward looking; all of a sudden noticed that something was sticking out of the loose earth…my God …it was a human finger!\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that instant a horrid scene flashed through my mind. This was a dead body just below the ground, could be decaying, and the conclusion was obvious … it was an unnatural death … most probably a murder.\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn’t need any more thoughts; just turned and swiftly walked out of the forest. My only thought was to go to the police station.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I was about to enter the City Police station, I saw her coming towards me. I was surprised, “How come you are here Subhrita?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I had just come to this side of the town when I saw you. Why are you entering the Police station?” She inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well come with me, I will explain, it is an outrageous situation. I found a murdered man…. near the same place where we heard that strange radio voice.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOn hearing me in detail she reacted in sympathy as we entered the Police station. “It is terrible…who is that poor man…I feel very bad for him…”\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon enough I was guiding a police team to that area in the forest .\\r\\n\\r\\nThenceforth about month and a half had passed. In the meantime, the dead man had been identified; an ex student of my Institute- 1992 batch. His name was Joseph. I had never met him.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this time investigation was in progress. The autopsy report had pointed to death by poisoning. By then I had become very preoccupied with my project so I couldn’t check further with the police. There was also no communication from Subhrita; last we had met in the police station.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat day was Saturday. I was passing through the same area, it was early evening; I was alone in my car, its radio tuned in to my favorite station when abruptly an assonant silence descended and I heard the scream. Straightaway my senses became alert; I pulled up the car at the side, listening intently. But it was not a male voice; it was the voice of a female and it sounded familiar… who was it ?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe radio station came back. I was unsure, sat there thinking, wondering whose voice that was? Minutes passed but I remained seated. Again the music faded away and there was the accompanying silence. And, moments later, came that scream, the pleading voice of a female and then the gurgling noise … my mind went in a convolution… I could recognize the voice now…it was of Subhrita !\\r\\n\\r\\nHeaven help me, how was that possible?\\r\\n\\r\\nI jerked open the car door stepping out in a rush, virtually ran towards the forest, reaching the same spot where I had found the dead body of Joseph. The surroundings were similar; falling darkness midst the forest … saw a hand protruding out of the ground… but now it was a female hand with gold bangles! With trembling countenance I cleared the loose ground; a body was lying face upturned… she was Subhrita!!\\r\\n\\r\\nPanicking I turned and ran out of the forest, entered my car and drove unsteadily towards the City Police Station.\\r\\n\\r\\nInspector Rathod was listening to me attentively.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you sure about the identity of the dead woman – Subhrita?” He had a curious look in his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Absolutely sure Inspector, no second thoughts, I knew her well…and as you would recall, we had come to you together during initial part of your investigation.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe reached for a file, shaking his head, “In that case the only thing I can say is that this is a very odd position.“\\r\\n\\r\\nThen opening the file he looked up, ”This is the investigation case file of Joseph.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout any further words, he stared at me for long moments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThereafter slamming the file close he said, “There are many aspects still to be probed in this case but you should understand that the prime suspect here is his ex girl friend… Subhrita.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And now you tell me this.” he grimaced.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat back astounded; it was unbelievable!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe police was suspecting that Subhrita had killed Joseph! Had Joseph retaliated by murdering her and burying in the same spot where he was buried? But how could he do that? He was dead. So was it his avenging ghost? And what about the enigma of voices in my radio? Were they the dying words of Joseph and Subhrita caught in freak radio waves which got transmitted time and again?\\r\\n\\r\\nDays had since passed. The investigation was progressing. I had been informed by Inspector Rathod that adjacent to the body of Subhrita he had found Joseph’s wrist watch. Telltale proof that Joseph was responsible for her death?\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps my thoughts were true!\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, this could become the unsolved case file of the Inspector .\\r\\n\\r\\n–END–\",\n  \"story_image\": \"http://mapi.trycatchtech.com/uploads/stories/1eecd7d67950945ac56581fc7bd59c4a.jpg\"\n}, {\n  \"post_id\": \"64\",\n  \"category_id\": \"9\",\n  \"post_name\": \"Devil’s Advocate\",\n  cover: book2img,\n  \"post_desc\": \"I stared down at my city because I wanted it to be the last thing I ever saw. The dim, flickering streetlights, the occasional flashing headlight of a vehicle and the peaceful resplendence of a neighbourhood in the middle of the night almost made my heart ache. But there was no turning back. The big clock in the middle of the city showed half an hour to midnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had reached a crossroads in life, and I had chosen the easy way out.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I stood on the bridge, miles above the nearest human being, I was ready to jump and end it all. I knew it would be a messy way to go, but I had made my mind up.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had no future. My life was a monotonous routine which I hated. I had no skills, no talent and no inspiration. There were a lot of times when I wanted to shake myself by the collar and ask me if I was truly happy with what I was doing. I believed I was.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman I loved and thought loved me back, left me three hours ago. We met at the coffee shop where she had once declared her undying love for me and told me her parents had fixed a wedding date for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wasn’t invited.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the events which took place were a bit of a haze. I have no idea how I ended up on top of the bridge, staring down at the night-life of the city below me.\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody would miss me. I had nobody who cared for me, nobody who’d recognise my name if it appeared in the papers tomorrow, nobody to claim my body in the morgue. In a short time, I’d be a stain on the pavement, as inconvenient as ever. The people who’d be hired to scrape me off the road would curse me, mumbling that I’d made more work for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was me, always a bother to everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nA cold wind had started to blow, causing goosebumps to erupt on my skin. Under the bridge, a narrow lane winded across me and extended as far as the eye could see. I’d have preferred to jump into the sea, but the nearest water body was miles away and I honestly didn’t care for walking any more. There was nothing else for it. I steeled myself and looked down again, trying to imagine the rush of wind as I fell, at the swirl of colours and noises I’d experience, how it’d all end in a sickening splat.\\r\\n\\r\\nDying wasn’t the hard part, falling was.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow would the life ebb out of me? Would it be snuffed out like a candle? Would the colour and sound around me gradually fade, like an old TV?\\r\\n\\r\\nWould it hurt?\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, it was time to find out. I glanced at the railings of the bridge. It had a dove carved on it every few metres, probably as a symbol of peace and life. How ironic.\\r\\n\\r\\nI gripped the railing tightly and took a deep breath. This was it. I hoisted one leg over the railing and prepared to jump.\\r\\n\\r\\nI closed my eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoodbye, cruel world, I thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Kind of a long way down, don’t you think?” said someone to my left.\\r\\n\\r\\nI almost lost my balance and fell headfirst.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it is, the foot which was still planted on the bridge skidded a little and I had to hold the railing tighter so that I wouldn’t fall. I opened my eyes wide and turned to see who had spoken.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What the he…” I started. And stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy eyes grew wide as I looked the… boy that had spoken. He was standing a few feet from me, leaning casually against the railing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first glance, he looked like any of the normal teenagers you’d see lounging around at a mall or any public place for that matter. Long hair, thin face, earphones trailing from each ear and a Smartphone in his hand, which he peering into. He wore a normal T-shirt and jeans as he stood with his back to the railing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem was, he had a tail.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m not talking a cute, curly doggy-tail. Picture a bright red, whip-like appendage, about three feet long, curled at his feet like a python. The tip of the tail was shaped like an arrow-head and as I watched, it lifted a couple of feet off the ground, made a motion like it was sniffing the air and fell back down.\\r\\n\\r\\nI blinked twice to make sure I wasn’t having a hallucination.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s rude to stare,” said the boy, in a sing-song voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy throat felt dry as I looked from the tail to his face, and back to the tail again. My brain was whirring like a old motor, trying to explain how a boy could have a tail.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, it’s some sort of costume. You know teenagers and their fads these days, it’s probably something to raise awareness about not cutting off dogs’ tails for PETA or something, that’s it…\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, it’s not a PETA thing. It’s a real tail,” said the boy, not looking up from his phone. “Want to touch it?” The tail shot off the ground, quick as a flash and the arrow-shaped tip hovered in front of my hand, as if it expected a handshake.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I hadn’t lost my voice at the sight of the tail, I’d have screamed bloody murder and slipped off the railing. But my mind was several seconds too slow, still trying to find a work-around as to the existence of the tail.\\r\\n\\r\\n“W-what is that?” I managed to whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe finally looked at me in the eye, and when he spoke, it was a condescending tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And here I thought you were a smart one. It’s a tail, man. What does it look like?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI blinked again, feeling a little faint. If my mind weren’t so full of committing suicide, I’d have phoned the authorities or perhaps the nearest asylum, since I was obviously seeing things.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shook my head and turned back, looking to move a bit further down the bridge. On the off chance the boy wasn’t an illusion, I didn’t want him to scar him for life by having him watch a man jump off a bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wouldn’t jump, if I were you,” came the boy’s voice behind me. “At least not for another 24 minutes.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI stopped dead. The wind which had been blowing stopped suddenly, and the air was deadly quiet. I turned back slowly and faced the boy, who had gone back to peering into his phone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What did you say?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glanced up at me for a brief instant.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I said, you don’t have to jump for another 24 minutes, unless you want to spend your last half-hour on earth writhing in agony.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy heart beat faster in my chest as I considered his words. The way he said them, the cock of his head and the slightest hint of the smile at the corner of his mouth, told me he was serious.\\r\\n\\r\\n“H-how did you know I was going to jump? Are you a detective or something? Did you deduce it from my breathing pattern?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe raised an eyebrow and considered me like I was talking out of my hat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Um, no. The Soul Reaper app told me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The what?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Soul Reaper app. You know, the app which tells you when, where and how many people are going to die.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOkay, look. I’d seen a lot of weird stuff in my life. I could accept a creepy teenager with a tail in the middle of the night, but I refuse to believe there was an app which told you when you’d die. I’d had it with this kid.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shook my head and turned to go again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It must’ve been hard when the love of your life chose money over you. Did you plan to die here all along, or did your feet just happen to bring you here? You’ve got no idea how many times that happens.” He said, again in that sing-song voice of his.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the second time, I stopped. I whirled around to look at him. He’d put the phone down and was looking at me with a mixture of amusement and excitement in his eyes, like I was a new plaything he was trying to learn the mechanics of.\\r\\n\\r\\n“H-how…”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How did I know you were going to commit suicide and your ex-girlfriend left you? Your profile is updated on the Find A Soul app.” He shook his phone at me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What the hell…”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look for yourself,” he said and threw the phone at me. I wasn’t expecting it, but caught it on reflex – and dropped it immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phone was hot on one side and cold on the other. It was like walking into an air-conditioned room after spending some time in the heat outside. I picked it up hastily, hoping it wasn’t scratched up. It wasn’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at the screen, which had my name and my photo on it. It had all my details, including my birthday, the hospital I was born in, and even the names of the nurses who oversaw my delivery. I scrolled down with shaking fingers, reading my life story. Even the most discreet of things I’d done, stuff I was sure that nobody had any idea about, where spelled out for the world to see. I skimmed through the text, till it stopped on the last line, which said,\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Abandoned by ex-girlfriend, ponders suicide on a bridge…’\\r\\n\\r\\nMy entire body was trembling. I didn’t know how, but I’d gotten myself involved in something supernatural. I looked at the boy, who made a little motion with his hands, like he was calling a puppy. The phone flew from my hands and into his, and he resumed peering into it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI gulped twice and tried to speak, but no words came out. I tried to ask about the app, the tail or what the heck was going on, but the question I dearly wanted to know the answer to sprung to my lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who are you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boy smiled. His cheekbones went back and revealed a set of pearly-white teeth, and he threw his head back, so the moonlight put his jaw in the shadow, and his tail perked up again, sniffing the air like an excited dog.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am Death, pleased to meet you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter almost jumping to my death, seeing a red tail on a boy and reading my life’s history on a Smartphone, you’d thing I couldn’t be gobsmacked anymore, but when this teenager told me he was Death, I literally cocked my head to one side and looked at him quizzically.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you don’t believe me.” He said, in a matter-of-fact tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Actually, now I understand why you have a tail,” I said, trying to sound brave, when actually my insides were quivering like jelly. “And I guess the phone is like your modern-day Death Note?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe brightened immediately and nodded. “That’s right! Now that’s one anime which got stuff right, even if they did take some liberties. I don’t have to actually write my victim’s names here, you know. I get their details, and I go to reap souls. That’s why I’m here right now,” he said, and gave me a toothy grin.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe moved closer to me, tapping on the screen as he walked, and held the phone in front of my face.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at the screen. It was a different colour now, black and red, and it said Soul Reaper on the top. I guessed this was the app he was talking about before.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the middle of the screen, one line kept flashing – Two, Under Stepston Bridge, Midnight.\\r\\n\\r\\n“See?” he said, smiling genially. “It says there’ll be two deaths under Stepston Bridge – this bridge, that is – at midnight, which is…” he consulted his watch, which was also black and red, with horns drawn into the dial, “about 16 minutes from now.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI gulped, as I stared at my literal death warrant.\\r\\n\\r\\n“S-so… that’s supposed to mean…”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You, yes,” he said and grinned again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“B-but it says two deaths,” I said, trying to put forward what I thought was a good point.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I know,” he said and shrugged. “I suppose the second victim will come along shortly, the app never lies you know.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI gulped again as my forehead felt wet with perspiration. I managed to find my voice again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“S-so… You really are…”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Death, with a capital D, yes.” He said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So even if I jump now, I’m not going to die until midnight?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe nodded again and leaned against the railing once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve looked into your records, and you’ve been a good man for most of your life, so I decided to give you a little heads-up. You can jump right now, but you’ll lie in a pool of your own blood, unable to scream from a crushed throat, looking at your own smashed brain and generally experience excruciating pain till midnight, which is when you’ll eventually snuff it. I thought you deserved a warning, and I had some free time, so here I am,” he said, with the air of one talking about the weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nA swirl of questions exploded inside in my mind with so much force that my head actually started to hurt. I opened my mouth to ask him more, especially about what death would bring, and what was next.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I didn’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn’t know why, but some small part of my mind told me some things were left best unanswered. I looked at his face and saw him peering intently into mine, a small smile playing at his lips. Without meaning to, I blushed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So,” I said, casting my mind around to talk about something, because I really hate awkward silences.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mh-hmm,” he said, burying his face in the screen. Suddenly, he looked up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you know I reaped a couple of souls at midnight under this bridge last year as well?” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stared at him, not prepared for a question like that. Apparently, it was rhetorical, for he continued.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A pair of drunk motorcyclists rammed into a couple just up there.” He pointed at a spot ahead the bridge. “Rammed the couple straight against the railing and crushed them. See that twisted railing over there with the carved dove missing? That’s where it happened.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe scratched his chin as he pointed to an old and warped railing, about thirty metres from us. It definitely looked all scraped up, like something heavy had pounded into it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yep, I reaped their souls myself. The boy was hardly older than you. The motorcyclists escaped, by the way, they were never seen again.” He said, and seemed deep in thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n“8 minutes to go, by the way,” he said, looking at his watch again. He got off the railing and stretched, looking almost bored.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Aren’t you going to ask me anything?” He said, doing some toe-touches.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well… Do you usually appear before people like this?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the guise of a boy, you mean? No, I vary it. Sometimes I’m an older man, or a black dog, I was even a raging fire once, now that was fun…”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Er, no. Do you often warn people they’re going to die?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boy – Death – raised an eyebrow. He swayed his head from side to side and considered it for a minute.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hm, I do believe this is my first time. Funny how that happens isn’t it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why did you do it for me?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI expected him to look me in the eye and tell me how I was central in the grand scheme of things and how I would be the key piece in an event that would change history as we would know it.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, he shrugged and said, ‘I was bored.’\\r\\n\\r\\nI sighed. So my brief appointment with death was a mere window for Death to have some fun and entertain himself. Even in death, I was merely a source of time pass.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ran my hands through my hair and looked at Death. He was smiling that creepy smile again, his face hungrily boring into mine. I sighed again. My life had been one big joke, and now it looks like my death would be the same.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Okay, one final question, and this is just because I’m curious, mind,” I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fire away. Five minutes left,”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now you’ve told me that I’ll die at midnight, what happens if I just walk away now? Does it mean I cheat death?”\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath stopped smiling. The air froze, and I suddenly started to shiver. Drops of sweat trickled down my back as Death fixed his eyes on mine.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh no, you never cheat death. Or Death, for that matter, don’t worry about that. Death is cold, calculating, final and inevitable. Death will come for you when you least expect it, oh yes. If you’ve got an appointment with Death, you keep it, or else…”\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath hadn’t frowned or even sounded angry, but his words cut through the air like a knife. Each syllable resonated in my ears as for the first time that night, I felt afraid.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’d had enough. I was going to die, and that was that. I gripped the railing so hard that my hand hurt. I glanced at the big clock in the city – it showed 4 minutes to midnight. Heck, I’d suffered all this long, what’s four more minutes?\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce again, I swung a leg over the railing. Death looked at me with a strange expression in his eyes. It was something hovering between curiosity… and was that pity?\\r\\n\\r\\nI swallowed and looked up at the night stars. They were beautiful. I took a breath and prepared to hoist my foot off the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s when I heard the scream.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was more like that start of a scream, and then it was abruptly cut off.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stopped and turned to my left, where the scream had come from. In the dim light of the streetlight, I could barely make out some people against the side of the bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nI slowly stepped back on to the road and peered closer. Beside me, Death had tucked his phone back into his pockets and was watching with an interested expression on his face. I moved a little closer, and the full sight of what was happening hit me like a truck.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo men were holding a woman against the side of the railing. One of them was holding her mouth shut while the other was looking left and right, scanning the surroundings. Either he was totally blind that he missed both me and Death, or he was so tensed he looked past us that he turned to his partner and nodded. The woman was visibly struggling under the other man’s grip as she flailed out with thin arms which made no impact.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why didn’t he see us?” I asked in a low voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I believe you’re standing in a bit of a blind spot. As for me, I chose to be invisible to them. Also, to answer your earlier question, I believe the second victim has arrived.” Said Death, nodding at the woman who was slipping lower and lower down the railing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“H-Her? W-what do you mean? Go stop them! Do something!” I said, gesticulating at the men. The one who was holding the girl slapped her hard. It echoed like a gunshot across the bridge, and she slumped down, unconscious.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath raised an eyebrow. “Why? I’m Death, remember? I’ve got souls to reap. And you’ve got three minutes to go, by the way.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI stared at him, wide-eyed. Ahead of me, both men were giving each other malevolent grins as the first one stepped back from the second. With a sickening realisation, I knew what fate awaited her.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ran forward, nearly tripping on my feet as I launched myself towards the two men.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath was right. I had been in a blind spot, because neither of them saw me until I was practically on top of them. I pushed the one who standing out of the way, and before he could react, clamped my arms around the first one’s neck, holding him in a half-nelson. I smelled the alcohol on his sour breath, and felt my head spin as it made its way through my nose.\\r\\n\\r\\nI pulled him to his feet as he struggled in front of me, making choking and gurgling sounds. I drove a knee into his back and he arched back. I tightened my grip and his attempts at fighting back was getting slower, his movements more laboured, no doubt a side-effect of the drinks he had consumed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was wresting the initiative from him. There was probably two minutes to go before I died and Death reaped my soul. Saving this girl would be the last thing I would ever do.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was when the second guy kicked my side. My grip on the first man loosened as I slammed into the railing, lights flashing before my eyes. I barely had time to cover my head before a shower of kicks came flying at me. I closed my eyes and winced as a heavy boot pummelled my arms and head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Got you, did he?” asked the second men.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first one had finished coughing and was looking at me with murder in his eyes. “Right well, he did. I say we finish him off before we start on the girl.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second man nodded and kicked me in the gut again. I rolled forward, holding my stomach and moaning in pain. He placed a boot on my neck and began to squeeze. Lights popped in my head and my throat started to constrict. My headache got worse till my head felt like it was about to burst open. I tried to prise the leg off my neck, but it was too strong.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the life ebbed away from me, I suddenly felt a tear slip down my cheek.\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn’t understand. I was ready for this for a long time. I was ready to leave everything behind in a world that had used me and given nothing back. I was ready to go on the next great adventure, ready to be a stain on the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen why was I crying?\\r\\n\\r\\nI opened my eyes and the answer came to me. I looked at the face of the unconscious woman. She was beautiful, in a sort of ethereal way. She didn’t deserve this fate. She deserved a full, happy life, with someone who could give it to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was like a switch had flicked on in my head.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was the one who was prepared to die, not her. She didn’t deserve to be the second victim tonight.\\r\\n\\r\\nA surge of strength poured through me as I lifted the boot off my neck with both arms. The man stumbled and backed away. I sprang to my feet and faced them. Both of them lunged towards me and grabbed me by the scruff of the collar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next few seconds happened in a flash. I remember grabbing both of their necks. Somehow, we’d all turned around so that they were with their backs to the railing. Their eyes raged in a frenzy as they both tried to strangle me.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I was stronger. I had decided to fight for another.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mind became blank as I did the first thing that came to my mind. I pushed with all my strength.\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt their grips loosen as both men fell backward, stumbled, and crashed into the railing.\\r\\n\\r\\nI only had a split-second view of the railing which they had slammed into. It was an old, twisted one, with a dove missing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith an almighty crash, the entire section of the railing gave way and both men disappeared from sight. A second later, I heard a sickening noise as they splattered on the ground underneath.\\r\\n\\r\\nFar away, the big clock in the middle of the city struck midnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nI slumped to the ground, shell-shocked at what had happened. My entire body trembled as I replayed the last minute in my head.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom my left, a voice called out,\\r\\n\\r\\n“Top stuff, very good.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI raised my head. Death was standing over me, a satisfied expression on his face. He took his phone out from his pocket, and as I watched, two small wisps of smoke zoomed out from under the bridge and went inside the phone. He nodded and put the phone back into his pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n“W-What…”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, those were their souls. I was promised two souls at midnight you see, and it seems I’ve collected my due.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“B-but you said you wanted my…”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your soul? Come now, don’t flatter yourself. I don’t recall saying that. I simply said two people would die here at midnight.” He pointed down the bridge where the bodies of the two men undoubtedly lay. “And they have. My job here is complete.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“S-so, I’m not going to die?” I managed to stutter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, the Soul Reaper app says the next death will happen another 500 miles from here in about 3 minutes. So unless you can travel that far, I’d say no.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy shoulders slumped. I began to tremble again, and this time, I realised that it was a different sort of tremble. I was laughing, actually laughing, and what more, I was literally laughing in the face of Death.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath smiled again and turned his back on me, no doubt to go to his next location of death.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tell me the truth,” I said. He stopped in his tracks.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why did you appear in front of me the way you did? Why did you stop me from jumping?”\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath didn’t turn around for a few seconds, and for a fleeting moment, I wondered if I’d crossed a line. Then, he half-glanced at me and spoke,\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you remember the accident I told you about? How two drunk motorcyclists killed a couple over here?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI nodded slowly. The girl near my feet was stirring.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, what if I told you the two men who died today were the same men who ran over the couple?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI stared at Death, thunderstruck.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What goes around doesn’t always come around, remember that. So every once in a while, I give it a little push, to keep the balance, to keep things from going haywire.” He turned around fully now and looked me in the eye. For the first time that night, I saw a bit of sadness in his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe clapped his hands, making me jump.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right then. I’m late for my next appointment. Last year, a couple was killed, and two men walked free. Today, two men were killed, and you two remain.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe pointed at me and the girl. “So be a good boy and take a hint, okay?” He made a kind of motion with his hands like he was telling us to hug.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Seriously? I barely know her!” The girl was emitting a small moan, and her eyelids were slowly fluttering.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, you’ve got to start somewhere, right? Here’s a piece of advice, keep it simple.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI rolled my eyes. “You’re Death. You’re supposed to be spreading suffering, not love.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce again, Death threw back his head and grinned. It was the most horrible thing I’d ever seen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who says they are so different from one another?” he said in a rich tone.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe started to shimmer, getting fainter by the second.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A parting word – Don’t die before you live. I look forward to the day I reap your soul.” He said, as his tail coiled around him, before vanishing entirely.\\r\\n\\r\\nI barely had a second to catch my breath before the girl at my feet shot awake and started looking around her like a feral animal. Her hands were closed into fists and she faced this way and that in abject terror. Finally, she noticed me and sprang back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“W-who…”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s fine. The men are gone. You’re okay now.” I said, holding up both hands in a placating gesture.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gone? W-where did they go?” She turned back and tried to look down the bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nI acted quickly. No point in having her see two dead bodies. I cupped my hand under her chin and made her face me. I drew closer, and looked her in the eye.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s safe,” I said, not breaking eye-contact. She had beautiful eyes, like two pools of black water.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll protect you,” I said, and meant it. She blushed and nodded. At second later, I felt like kicking myself for saying a stupid thing like that.\\r\\n\\r\\nI got up and offered a hand. She took it and I helped her up. I offered to walk her home, and she agreed. We walked wordlessly, side by side, down the empty bridge. I didn’t let go of her hand the entire time.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath was right. You didn’t die before you lived.\\r\\n\\r\\nI tried to die once, and it didn’t quite appeal to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I was ready to live.\\r\\n\\r\\n–END–\",\n  \"story_image\": \"http://mapi.trycatchtech.com/uploads/stories/e83d5c3bb0fc3eeb5fc63fbfd31ac25a.jpg\"\n}, {\n  \"post_id\": \"63\",\n  \"category_id\": \"9\",\n  \"post_name\": \"The Piggy Back Ride\",\n  cover: book3img,\n  \"post_desc\": \"A married couple fought a great deal and finally began talking about getting a divorce.

Before long the old problems resurfaced and the father and mother were fighting all the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night, when the boy was about 5 years old, the couple put the boy to bed and then got into an enormous fight. In a fit of rage, the father put his hands around his wife’s neck and choked the life out of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nEventually, when he realised what he had done, he began to panic.

The following story has been presented as “true” by many past storytellers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time, there was a 10 year old girl who lived in London in a very old house. She hated the house. It was cold and damp all of the time. Plus, none of her friends would visit because it was believed by everyone in the neighbourhood that a ghost lived in the house. The little girl was curious about the ghost, but nobody would talk to her when she asked questions about it or the history of the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house was scary, and some nights were worse than others. One night, when she was in her room reading, the lamp suddenly went off. She thought the light bulb had died. She did not want to bother her mother, who was already sleeping, by asking for a new bulb. So she put down her book and prepared to sleep. All of a sudden, there was a quiet knocking on the window next to her bed. She saw the reflection of a boy, about her age, reflected on the window glass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl turned to look in her room, but saw nothing. She got out of bed and went over to her lamp. She felt something wet on the ground. She flicked on the lamp, which now worked, and saw a red stain where she was standing. Then it disappeared. It wasn’t blood, because the red was too bright, almost pink, like paint. She scratched at the purple wall of her room and, believe it or not, behind the purple paint was pink, the same dark shade that had been on the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl ran out of her room toward her parent’s room. But then she saw something that made her open her mouth to scream, though no sound came out. The attic door was right above her staircase, really high up; only her dad could reach it. Hanging from it was a noose, the thing they hung people on.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl ran back to her room and there was a body in her bed. She grabbed her phone to take a picture. She wanted proof. She wanted to know in the morning if what she saw was a dream or real. She took a picture of her bed, and, without looking at it, ran to get her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrumpily, her mother came up the stairs. The girl pointed to where the noose had been, but now it was just a piece of string from her mother’s sewing kit. She led her mother up to her room, to show her the child’s body, but now there was nothing. As her mother turned to leave the room, the girl remembered the camera. She grabbed it and turned it on, showing it to her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no longer a photo of her bed. Instead there was a photo of a teenage boy, with a red mark around his neck, and pink paint all over his torn clothes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer mother told her stop joking around. However, her mother had an extremely worried look on her face. When asked what was wrong, she said, “He is back!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little girl never saw the boy again and her mother refused to tell her who he was.\",\n  \"story_image\": \"http://mapi.trycatchtech.com/uploads/stories/5dfb5d0dff05e87b05b957aa277991b7.jpg\"\n}, {\n  \"post_id\": \"61\",\n  \"category_id\": \"9\",\n  \"post_name\": \"Hide and Seek\",\n  cover: book5img,\n  \"post_desc\": \"This scary story for kids ends with a question, the answers to which can make the story even scarier.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo young brothers were at home alone in the apartment while their parents visited their neighbours next door for a while.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Be good boys,” their parents said.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo keep themselves occupied the boys decided to play a game of hide and seek. The older boy turned his head to the wall and began to count. He could hear his little brother’s feet as he scampered about looking for a place to hide.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ready or not I’m coming,” cried the older brother and off he went looking for his brother. He looked in all the usual places, behind the sofa, in the bathroom behind the shower curtain, behind the curtains in every room, and under all the beds, but he couldn’t find him. The apartment was eerily silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he heard a scraping sound coming from the wardrobe. The boy was sure he’d already looked there, but he went anyway and called out, “Come out I’ve found you!” but there was only silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain he called for his brother to come out and again nothing. Opening the door, the boy tried to peer behind the wall of dresses and coats hanging there. He bent down, but he did not see any feet standing there.

We enjoyed the ride and each every moment is still cherished. Our ancestral house was situated a little away from the small town and each house stood in hectares of land unlike the ones we stayed in the city. Our village days began with early morning prayers. During the day Nandu and I along with the village children played a lot of “desi games” the ones which were found only in the villages, ate ghee sweets prepared by grandmother, enjoyed the milk from Nandini our cow, climbed trees, went hiking, etc. At night our grandmother made sure that we went early to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe enjoyed each and every corner of the village. The village seemed to have something that the city lacked. But there was one such place that the elders prohibited us from visiting. And that was the little green house that stood in the corner of the lane. The house was quite pretty from outside. There was a beautiful garden with a path paved from the gate to the entrance of the house. Though the house looked quite old it looked beautiful. We kids wanted to explore the place. But we never ever were given a chance to. Stories revolved that the house was haunted by a lady who had been murdered. The ghost was seen by some elders in the village. The underlying mystery was unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne Sunday evening with the permission of our grandmother, Nandu and I along with the village children visited the temple fair in our village. We promised our grandmother that we will be back before the dusk had set in. And as to our word Nandu and I walked back to our house while the other children returned to theirs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night had started to set in. The trees were creaky and the owls flew among them. We walked through the lane. The green house could be viewed at a distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly Nandu said, “ Didi can we go to the green house?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“But Nandu granny will be furious with us.” I replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Nandu had made up his mind. He was slowly pulling my hands and before I could make out we had entered the compound of the house. The house looked a little dirtier than we could we see from outside the compound. Dried leaves lay all along the ground. We moved one step at a time to the entrance of the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe pushed the doors of the house and it opened . Nandu and I walked through the dark passage of the house. The lights of the house were broken. Even if they were not electricity was out of question. But the courtyard brought in the silver moonlight into the house. The moonlight led us into a huge room with some broken old furniture.\\r\\n\\r\\n“ Didi do you expect a ghost here?” asked Nandu.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shh….” I had to silence Nandu. I wondered if the ghost stories were true. We moved from room to room. The walls of the room were decorated with huge scary paintings.\\r\\n\\r\\n“ Nandu lets go home. Granny will worry.” I said.\\r\\n\\r\\nNandu reluctantly agreed and soon we walked back to the front door. We tried to open the door but to our dismay the doors would not open. It had got locked from outside.\\r\\n\\r\\n“ Didi what shall we do?” Nandu started to cry.\\r\\n\\r\\n“ Nandu don’t cry let’s see if there is any other way out” I comforted him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe moved through the house trying to find some rear entrance or openings. The rear doors were all locked from outside. I realized we were trapped.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe sat in the passage a little scared. The whole place looked very weird with cobwebs and large scary huge black poisonous spiders. The night passed and midnight arrived. Hoots of some wild animals, cry of cats and all sorts of frightening sounds filled the air. For once I felt that we had lost our lives to some ghosts. I could hear the rain falling heavily outside. I cried silently.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Didi wake up.” I could feel Nandu’s small hands on my face.\\r\\n\\r\\nI opened my eyes. The first rays of sunlight crept through the courtyard ceiling. In the daylight we saw a much prettier ghost house this time less scary than it appeared in the night. The courtyard had a glass ceiling and the sunlight was coming through them. The pictures which seemed scary the previous night looked beautiful and aristocratic. They looked like some modern art and pictures of gods. The house must have belonged to someone who had a deep interest in paintings.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nandu let’s see if we can get out of this place.  Granny would have filed a case at the village police station by now.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe moved through the rooms to see if there were any openings we could not see because of the dark the previous night. The rooms looked much better though it was very dirty.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Didi what is that?” Nandu pointed to a huge chest in the corner. It looked like a treasure chest. The metal on top of the box depicted a devilish face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ghosts live in the dark” whispering these words to myself I opened the chest. We were surprised to see the chest full of antiques, gold, jewellery, precious and semi precious stones and what and all.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hey Didi look granny’s bronze elephant” Nandu shouted.\\r\\n\\r\\nGranny had a bronze elephant with beautiful big tusks which had been stolen by some thieves some years back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nandu this chest contains things stolen from the villagers” I replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe could hear noises outside and soon the front door opened. The village police had arrived to rescue us.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nandu , Lakshmi… …”Granny’s eyes were filled with tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Granny see… your bronze elephant” Nandu was excited.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of us walked out of the house into the village lane. There was a crowd outside but we children walked like heroes from some detective story who had helped the poor villagers to hunt their treasure. The air was filled with gossips of how we children had recovered the lost belongings. It seems there was no ghost that lived in the house and the thieves who had kept the stolen things had spread fear among the villagers. Anyway whatever the truth might be Nandu and I dare not to visit the green house again. That scary dark night ……….\\r\\n\\r\\n__END__\",\n  \"story_image\": \"http://mapi.trycatchtech.com/uploads/stories/b4ae79b721ac0593d88ded50f675cebd.jpg\"\n}, {\n  \"post_id\": \"59\",\n  \"category_id\": \"9\",\n  \"post_name\": \" SIR, I AM THE MURDERER…\",\n  cover: book7img,\n  \"post_desc\": \"“Sir, I am a murderer.” She was trembling while saying this. She was sitting in our police station, opposite to my table. She was there to surrender herself. I was the in charge of the police station.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a beautiful lady of about 22 or 23 years, had long hairs which were maintained really nicely, wearing pink shirt and dark blue jeans, had sunglasses on her eyes. She was looking from a nice and rich family.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who did you killed?” Well I asked her after taking a long pause because her first sentence was not really expected or if I talk frankly, I was lost in her beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have killed 3 people.” I was really surprised to hear that. A girl, so pretty, can kill 3 people and also committing it in front of police. The whole thing was a bit unusual for me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have killed my Gardner, my driver and ……..” She paused a bit and started to sob. “And my mother.” She started crying hard. I gave her water and she started to take sip from that glass.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she controlled her emotions, she continued to talk. “Please I beg of you, please arrest me otherwise I will kill someone else also.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why did you kill them and why will you kill others? Mam………. What’s your name?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shilpa.” She was still sobbing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shilpa, why did you kill them?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know. I just happened automatically.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shilpa, I am not getting it. And I cannot arrest you without any complaint and without seeing the body of the dead people you are talking about.” She was looking very tense to me. So I continued, “Shilpa, where are the bodies?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I dug them in my garden.” She was not looking like fake but what she was saying was even not looks to be believed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI decided to go to her house. I took two constables also with me. When we reached her house she took us to her garden and told us the places where the body of the gardener and driver were dug. I commanded the constables to take the bodies out.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where’s the body of your mother?” I asked Shilpa.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Inside the home.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI started to follow Shilpa. She took me inside the house and then stopped in front of a dark room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Inside. My mother is lying inside.” She started to cry again.\\r\\n\\r\\nI slowly started to move inside the room. The room was so dark that it was difficult to see anything. I had one torch with me so I decided to turn that on. I searched the whole room but the room was empty. Then I saw one room which was closed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI opened that room. And got shocked to see that there were three bodies lying inside the room. Two men may be Shilpa’s gardener and driver and one old lady may be her mother. I was wondering why Shilpa told me that bodies are out there in garden.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ahhhhhh………” Someone stabbed me from behind. I turned around. I was shocked to see Shilpa standing with a knife in her right hand covered with blood of mine.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why?” I asked her in a trembling voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe came closer to me and stabbed in my stomach and said, “Because, it’s fun.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI fell on ground and she took my gun and rushed outside. I heard two fires. She killed my constables also\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw her last image standing in front of mirror, combing her hairs and singing song………….\\r\\n\\r\\n__END__\",\n  \"story_image\": \"http://mapi.trycatchtech.com/uploads/stories/ffabfa0d5c0ba8785bc6607afea94e32.jpg\"\n}, {\n  \"post_id\": \"58\",\n  \"category_id\": \"9\",\n  \"post_name\": \"Mysterious friend\",\n  cover: book8img,\n  \"post_desc\": \"Lakshmi was waiting for her daughter Kavya to return home.

But for Kavya that was not enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany times Lakshmi asked Hari to move to some other home near to town just for Kavya, so she could find many friends in town, but Hari keeps postponing it. Meanwhile, Kavya got used to play alone and spend a lot of time at the river side.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the days were going like this, one day Kavya had come home happily and told that she got a friend at the river side. Lakshmi was surprised as per as she knows, there were no one living near to their home, so there is no chance for anyone to come there to play. But when Kavya described her like how she talks, how she looks, then she started believing that that girl could be coming from a nearby village. As per her description, she was same age of Kavya and every day she comes by just wearing a kid’s panty. But Lakshmi was curious to know how come such a small girl comes alone from a village.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe asked Kavya to bring her to home. But she refused to bring her as her friend doesn’t like to come to their home. And her friend told to Kavya that no one should see her; otherwise she wouldn’t meet her again. After hearing that, Lakshmi started suspecting her friend. She told to Hari about Kavya’s mysterious friend. But he didn’t care much about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat day Lakshmi decided at any cost she should find who was she? So she prepared Kavya’s favorite sweet to sooth her and find more details about her friend. She was waiting for her to come back to home. After some time, she came.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hi Sweety, you know what I prepared for you. Can you guess?”, she said by carrying her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hey… mummy… I know you prepared Gulab Jamun … I like it”, She was very happy. Lakshmi nodded and took her to the kitchen and gave a Gulab Jamun. While she was eating, she asked, “Sweety, does your friend also like Gulab Jamun ?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, mummy”, she said gulping the Jamun.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy don’t you take this to your friend? She might feel very happy, Ok”, she said by giving a box to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ya, you are right mummy. She feels very happy… you are very nice”, she said by taking that box.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Will you go now? Are your friend still be at the river side “, she asked by looking at her carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ya mummy she stays always there. Even she doesn’t have any friends…, so I go and give it right now”, she said and ready to leave home.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ok, come quickly … and be careful alright”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes… mummy and my friend feels very happy after seeing this sweet… bye”, she said and went outside.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter few seconds, Lakshmi followed her, and she was extremely careful so that Kavya wouldn’t notice her. When she reached the bay, she was stunned after seeing what Kavya was doing at that place. Actually there was no one other than Kavya at that place. She was talking alone and feeding Gulab Jamun in air. She was talking such a way that someone was sitting beside of her. Lakshmi went quickly and stood in front of Kavya and shouted, “Sweety… What are doing alone here?”,\\r\\n\\r\\nKavya looked startled after seeing her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mummy… Why you came? I told you shouldn’t come here… see…my friend left”, she muffled.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shut-up… you don’t have any friends here… you were talking alone here… “, she said in hysteric manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nKavya has never seen her mother before like that. She started crying, “I was talking with my friend only… I was not taking alone… she has left because you came…”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Enough… come home”, she grabbed her hand and took her to home.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they reached home, Kavya was still crying and went inside of her bedroom and closed the door. Lakshmi was terribly upset to see her kid talking alone. She waited for Hari to come home, so that she could share what happened today to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh… that is very common baby… kids sometimes behaves like that… they make friendship with imaginary people… and they talk with them… so don’t make it as a big issue… take it easy”, Hari said to her when she told about what happened that day.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe didn’t expect that answer from him as she thought he would take Kavya to some doctor for check-up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But… honey… it is not good behavior for anyone to talk on their own… so can we have to take her to the hospital?“, She is worried.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I told you … take it easy… it’s not that big problem… alright … I’ve to take a bath”, he said and went to the bathroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Lakshmi was not convinced at all; however she wanted to keep a close eye on her daughter actions. Her worry was doubled when Kavya one day told her that her friend came to her bedroom to talk to her as since after that incident Lakshmi was not allowing Kavya to go to the river side.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What did she tell to you?” she was curious to know.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She is very angry on you mummy as you are not allowing me to talk to her. She told that she would kill you… but I pleaded her not to do that… she is not like before… she is changed so much… I’m afraid mummy”, she is frightened.\\r\\n\\r\\nLakshmi face turned pale and terrified to hear “Killing” word from five years old kid mouth. She hugged her immediately, “nothing is going to happen Sweety… don’t worry … ok”, she tried to sooth her. Inside she thought, why the hell she was talking like that; she strongly determined to take her to the doctor before situation goes out of her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t understand what’s the matter with you… you are not listening my words… we must take her to the doctor… she is behaving like a crazy girl… today she said her imaginary friend is going to kill me… do you wait until she turns to a MAD girl”, Lakshmi was shouting on Hari.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Calm down Lakshmi… nothing is going to happen … just wait for few days everything is going to be alright”, Hari was trying to calm down her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When… when it will happen… you don’t like to change the house…You don’t like to take her to doctor… you don’t like anything to happen… why? I have to know today … that’s it”, she was shouting in a hysteric manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No … we can’t take her to any doctor… because… “, Hari stopped and he didn’t know what else to tell.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because… why??? Why we can’t take her to any doctor??? Now I’m realizing why… because you don’t like her… you don’t have any affection on her… “,\\r\\n\\r\\nHari got angry and crunched his fist, “Shut-up… I didn’t want to take her… because there is NO “HER”… our Sweety is DIED … yes… OUR KID IS DEAD … when we moved here… you took her in a boat on the river… but… that time the boat crashed into tree and flipped. And you both had fallen in the river… you were able to survive, but our Sweety had drowned to death… “, he burst into tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was shocked and looking at him unbelievably.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe continued, “after that incident… you didn’t believe that our kid is no more… you started behaving as if she is still alive and playing with us… you constructed a dream world, where our Sweety lived with us and has grown up… it was you… you didn’t like to change home, because if we move to a different home.. you might recall that Sweety is no more…, but you didn’t want that… you wanted to live in your dream world … and feel our Sweety presence… but you don’t understand… how much torture I had gone through by seeing you like that … “, he stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No… you are telling lies… our Sweety is alive… I can show you… she is sleeping… she is alive“, Lakshmi muttered and fell on floor unconsciously.\\r\\n\\r\\n__END__\",\n  \"story_image\": \"http://mapi.trycatchtech.com/uploads/stories/33403e8acb66f0ac0800487972a699ea.jpg\"\n}];","map":{"version":3,"names":["hero1img","authorimg","hero2img","hero3img","hero4img","pop1img","pop2img","pop3img","pop4img","life1img","life2img","life3img","life4img","tpost1img","tpost2img","tpost3img","g1img","g2img","g3img","g4img","g5img","d1img","d2img","d3img","d4img","d5img","d6img","book1img","book2img","book3img","book4img","book5img","book6img","book7img","book8img","hero","id","cover","catgeory","title","authorName","authorImg","time","desc","para1","para2","para3","details","quote","world","desct","descb","popular","date","comments","ppost","lifestyle","tpost","gallery","discover","lolp"],"sources":["D:/vs code program/reactjs/reactjsfinalblogproject/src/dummyData.js"],"sourcesContent":["import hero1img from './images/hero/hero1.jpg'\nimport authorimg from './images/author.jpg'\nimport hero2img from './images/hero/hero2.jpg'\nimport hero3img from './images/hero/hero3.jpg'\nimport hero4img from './images/hero/hero4.jpg'\nimport pop1img from './images/ppost/pop1.jpg'\nimport pop2img from './images/ppost/pop2.jpg'\nimport pop3img from './images/ppost/pop3.jpg'\nimport pop4img from './images/ppost/pop4.jpg'\nimport life1img from './images/life/life1.jpg'\nimport life2img from './images/life/life2.jpg'\nimport life3img from './images/life/life3.jpg'\nimport life4img from './images/life/life4.jpg'\nimport tpost1img from './images/tpost/tpost.webp'\nimport tpost2img from './images/tpost/tpost2.jpg'\nimport tpost3img from './images/tpost/tpost3.jpg'\nimport g1img from './images/gallery/g1.jpg'\nimport g2img from './images/gallery/g2.jpg'\nimport g3img from './images/gallery/g3.jpg'\nimport g4img from './images/gallery/g4.jpg'\nimport g5img from './images/gallery/g5.jpg'\nimport d1img from './images/discover/d1.jpg'\nimport d2img from './images/discover/d2.jpg'\nimport d3img from './images/discover/d3.jpg'\nimport d4img from './images/discover/d4.jpg'\nimport d5img from './images/discover/d5.jpg'\nimport d6img from './images/discover/d6.jpg'\nimport book1img from './images/book/book1.jpg'\nimport book2img from './images/book/book2.jpg'\nimport book3img from './images/book/book3.jpg'\nimport book4img from './images/book/book4.jpg'\nimport book5img from './images/book/book5.jpg'\nimport book6img from './images/book/book6.jpg'\nimport book7img from './images/book/book7.jpg'\nimport book8img from './images/book/book8.jpg'\n\n\nexport const hero = [\n  {\n    id: 1,\n    // cover: \"../images/hero/hero1.jpg\",\n    cover: hero1img,\n    catgeory: \"featured\",\n    title: \"Amitabh Bachchan sings 'Tu Cheez Badi Hai Musk Musk' for restored blue tick\",\n    authorName: \"Pravin\",\n    // authorImg: \"../images/author.jpg\",\n    authorImg: authorimg,\n    time: \"22 Apr - 2023\",\n    desc: [\n      {\n        para1: \"You audience.

I was driving my Honda Sedan and Subhrita, my Assistant Professor, was sitting in the front passenger seat. It was about 6.15 pm and the sun was already setting; its orange glow lighting up the far end of the sky; the birds were flying away in a flock.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the way back, there was a long stretch of dense forest, quite a few kilometers I would presume. At that time the road was passing through the unbroken wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the drive was long and arduous, I felt like taking a break. Pulling to the side and switching off the engine I looked at Subhrita, “Can I have a cup of coffee from the flask?“ She nodded and picked up the flask from the rear seat.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile sipping the coffee, I switched on the radio in the car tuning into the local FM band. A popular song started playing. I was feeling momentarily relaxed. Subhrita was gazing out of the window from her side – thick green forest was around us appearing to engulf us.\\r\\n\\r\\nTime passed. The home bound birds were chirping but umpteen forest noises were increasingly becoming more audible; many parts of the flora were getting covered in the shadows due to gradual oncoming of darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoffee over, I was about to start the car when suddenly the song on the radio died away; must be some signal problem; silence descended … followed by noise of radio static… and then a blood curdling scream… so horrific that my senses dulled for a moment – the hair on my neck started bristling; a man’s voice floated in indistinctly, “Help… somebody help….I am dying…” It ended with a gurgling noise as if the man had been strangulated. Abruptly thereafter there was complete silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon the music restarted as if there was no interruption.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stared at the radio and then turned towards Subhrita, “What was that?” My face showed a mixture of surprise and apprehension.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe frowned, “I don’t know…something very eerie, somebody seems to be in trouble, but how can that voice come through the radio? Let’s go home fast.” She looked away appearing nervous; it was natural.\\r\\n\\r\\nI leaned forward and fiddled with the radio; everything appeared normal. Could it be some type of advertisement or radio play or it might be a cross radio channel? I scratched my head. What should I do?\\r\\n\\r\\nThat incident passed without any further occurrence and we returned home about an hour later; by which time darkness had fallen.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would not have thought about the strange experience any further but for another incident which happened about a week later. I was alone in my car that day traveling on the same highway, nearing the identical place, the only difference was the time ; it was early afternoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomehow my sixth sense was hinting that something will not be right. And that happened. This time exactly similar ghostly phenomenon occurred with the voice trailing, “…….I am dying… ,” followed by a gurgling noise.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stopped the car. The daylight of a sunny afternoon made me more bold and besides a repetition had ensured that it was not a sudden shock.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther vehicles were plying on the road. I alighted from the car and looked around. I was not sure what I intended to do except that I felt that the mystery would be solved here.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had parked the car on the left side of the road, so it was instinctive that I looked at the forest at that side. Gradually I started walking inside. Due to the heavy vegetation a few steps inside drastically curtailed the brightness of the sun and a peculiar smell hit my nose. With whatever dim light which was percolating through the leaves and branches I saw the ground and found that it was covered with fallen leaves at various places; strewn around.\\r\\n\\r\\nA portion of the open ground a little away on my right, caught my eyes. It looked as if it was dug up and then covered in haste. The area was relatively clear as compared to the adjoining areas. I went forward looking; all of a sudden noticed that something was sticking out of the loose earth…my God …it was a human finger!\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that instant a horrid scene flashed through my mind. This was a dead body just below the ground, could be decaying, and the conclusion was obvious … it was an unnatural death … most probably a murder.\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn’t need any more thoughts; just turned and swiftly walked out of the forest. My only thought was to go to the police station.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I was about to enter the City Police station, I saw her coming towards me. I was surprised, “How come you are here Subhrita?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I had just come to this side of the town when I saw you. Why are you entering the Police station?” She inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well come with me, I will explain, it is an outrageous situation. I found a murdered man…. near the same place where we heard that strange radio voice.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOn hearing me in detail she reacted in sympathy as we entered the Police station. “It is terrible…who is that poor man…I feel very bad for him…”\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon enough I was guiding a police team to that area in the forest .\\r\\n\\r\\nThenceforth about month and a half had passed. In the meantime, the dead man had been identified; an ex student of my Institute- 1992 batch. His name was Joseph. I had never met him.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this time investigation was in progress. The autopsy report had pointed to death by poisoning. By then I had become very preoccupied with my project so I couldn’t check further with the police. There was also no communication from Subhrita; last we had met in the police station.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat day was Saturday. I was passing through the same area, it was early evening; I was alone in my car, its radio tuned in to my favorite station when abruptly an assonant silence descended and I heard the scream. Straightaway my senses became alert; I pulled up the car at the side, listening intently. But it was not a male voice; it was the voice of a female and it sounded familiar… who was it ?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe radio station came back. I was unsure, sat there thinking, wondering whose voice that was? Minutes passed but I remained seated. Again the music faded away and there was the accompanying silence. And, moments later, came that scream, the pleading voice of a female and then the gurgling noise … my mind went in a convolution… I could recognize the voice now…it was of Subhrita !\\r\\n\\r\\nHeaven help me, how was that possible?\\r\\n\\r\\nI jerked open the car door stepping out in a rush, virtually ran towards the forest, reaching the same spot where I had found the dead body of Joseph. The surroundings were similar; falling darkness midst the forest … saw a hand protruding out of the ground… but now it was a female hand with gold bangles! With trembling countenance I cleared the loose ground; a body was lying face upturned… she was Subhrita!!\\r\\n\\r\\nPanicking I turned and ran out of the forest, entered my car and drove unsteadily towards the City Police Station.\\r\\n\\r\\nInspector Rathod was listening to me attentively.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you sure about the identity of the dead woman – Subhrita?” He had a curious look in his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Absolutely sure Inspector, no second thoughts, I knew her well…and as you would recall, we had come to you together during initial part of your investigation.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe reached for a file, shaking his head, “In that case the only thing I can say is that this is a very odd position.“\\r\\n\\r\\nThen opening the file he looked up, ”This is the investigation case file of Joseph.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout any further words, he stared at me for long moments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThereafter slamming the file close he said, “There are many aspects still to be probed in this case but you should understand that the prime suspect here is his ex girl friend… Subhrita.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And now you tell me this.” he grimaced.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat back astounded; it was unbelievable!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe police was suspecting that Subhrita had killed Joseph! Had Joseph retaliated by murdering her and burying in the same spot where he was buried? But how could he do that? He was dead. So was it his avenging ghost? And what about the enigma of voices in my radio? Were they the dying words of Joseph and Subhrita caught in freak radio waves which got transmitted time and again?\\r\\n\\r\\nDays had since passed. The investigation was progressing. I had been informed by Inspector Rathod that adjacent to the body of Subhrita he had found Joseph’s wrist watch. Telltale proof that Joseph was responsible for her death?\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps my thoughts were true!\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, this could become the unsolved case file of the Inspector .\\r\\n\\r\\n–END–\",\n    \"story_image\": \"http://mapi.trycatchtech.com/uploads/stories/1eecd7d67950945ac56581fc7bd59c4a.jpg\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"post_id\": \"64\",\n    \"category_id\": \"9\",\n    \"post_name\": \"Devil’s Advocate\",\n    cover: book2img,\n    \"post_desc\": \"I stared down at my city because I wanted it to be the last thing I ever saw. The dim, flickering streetlights, the occasional flashing headlight of a vehicle and the peaceful resplendence of a neighbourhood in the middle of the night almost made my heart ache. But there was no turning back. The big clock in the middle of the city showed half an hour to midnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had reached a crossroads in life, and I had chosen the easy way out.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I stood on the bridge, miles above the nearest human being, I was ready to jump and end it all. I knew it would be a messy way to go, but I had made my mind up.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had no future. My life was a monotonous routine which I hated. I had no skills, no talent and no inspiration. There were a lot of times when I wanted to shake myself by the collar and ask me if I was truly happy with what I was doing. I believed I was.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman I loved and thought loved me back, left me three hours ago. We met at the coffee shop where she had once declared her undying love for me and told me her parents had fixed a wedding date for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wasn’t invited.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the events which took place were a bit of a haze. I have no idea how I ended up on top of the bridge, staring down at the night-life of the city below me.\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody would miss me. I had nobody who cared for me, nobody who’d recognise my name if it appeared in the papers tomorrow, nobody to claim my body in the morgue. In a short time, I’d be a stain on the pavement, as inconvenient as ever. The people who’d be hired to scrape me off the road would curse me, mumbling that I’d made more work for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was me, always a bother to everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nA cold wind had started to blow, causing goosebumps to erupt on my skin. Under the bridge, a narrow lane winded across me and extended as far as the eye could see. I’d have preferred to jump into the sea, but the nearest water body was miles away and I honestly didn’t care for walking any more. There was nothing else for it. I steeled myself and looked down again, trying to imagine the rush of wind as I fell, at the swirl of colours and noises I’d experience, how it’d all end in a sickening splat.\\r\\n\\r\\nDying wasn’t the hard part, falling was.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow would the life ebb out of me? Would it be snuffed out like a candle? Would the colour and sound around me gradually fade, like an old TV?\\r\\n\\r\\nWould it hurt?\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, it was time to find out. I glanced at the railings of the bridge. It had a dove carved on it every few metres, probably as a symbol of peace and life. How ironic.\\r\\n\\r\\nI gripped the railing tightly and took a deep breath. This was it. I hoisted one leg over the railing and prepared to jump.\\r\\n\\r\\nI closed my eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoodbye, cruel world, I thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Kind of a long way down, don’t you think?” said someone to my left.\\r\\n\\r\\nI almost lost my balance and fell headfirst.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it is, the foot which was still planted on the bridge skidded a little and I had to hold the railing tighter so that I wouldn’t fall. I opened my eyes wide and turned to see who had spoken.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What the he…” I started. And stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy eyes grew wide as I looked the… boy that had spoken. He was standing a few feet from me, leaning casually against the railing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first glance, he looked like any of the normal teenagers you’d see lounging around at a mall or any public place for that matter. Long hair, thin face, earphones trailing from each ear and a Smartphone in his hand, which he peering into. He wore a normal T-shirt and jeans as he stood with his back to the railing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem was, he had a tail.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m not talking a cute, curly doggy-tail. Picture a bright red, whip-like appendage, about three feet long, curled at his feet like a python. The tip of the tail was shaped like an arrow-head and as I watched, it lifted a couple of feet off the ground, made a motion like it was sniffing the air and fell back down.\\r\\n\\r\\nI blinked twice to make sure I wasn’t having a hallucination.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s rude to stare,” said the boy, in a sing-song voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy throat felt dry as I looked from the tail to his face, and back to the tail again. My brain was whirring like a old motor, trying to explain how a boy could have a tail.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, it’s some sort of costume. You know teenagers and their fads these days, it’s probably something to raise awareness about not cutting off dogs’ tails for PETA or something, that’s it…\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, it’s not a PETA thing. It’s a real tail,” said the boy, not looking up from his phone. “Want to touch it?” The tail shot off the ground, quick as a flash and the arrow-shaped tip hovered in front of my hand, as if it expected a handshake.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I hadn’t lost my voice at the sight of the tail, I’d have screamed bloody murder and slipped off the railing. But my mind was several seconds too slow, still trying to find a work-around as to the existence of the tail.\\r\\n\\r\\n“W-what is that?” I managed to whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe finally looked at me in the eye, and when he spoke, it was a condescending tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And here I thought you were a smart one. It’s a tail, man. What does it look like?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI blinked again, feeling a little faint. If my mind weren’t so full of committing suicide, I’d have phoned the authorities or perhaps the nearest asylum, since I was obviously seeing things.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shook my head and turned back, looking to move a bit further down the bridge. On the off chance the boy wasn’t an illusion, I didn’t want him to scar him for life by having him watch a man jump off a bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wouldn’t jump, if I were you,” came the boy’s voice behind me. “At least not for another 24 minutes.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI stopped dead. The wind which had been blowing stopped suddenly, and the air was deadly quiet. I turned back slowly and faced the boy, who had gone back to peering into his phone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What did you say?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glanced up at me for a brief instant.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I said, you don’t have to jump for another 24 minutes, unless you want to spend your last half-hour on earth writhing in agony.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy heart beat faster in my chest as I considered his words. The way he said them, the cock of his head and the slightest hint of the smile at the corner of his mouth, told me he was serious.\\r\\n\\r\\n“H-how did you know I was going to jump? Are you a detective or something? Did you deduce it from my breathing pattern?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe raised an eyebrow and considered me like I was talking out of my hat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Um, no. The Soul Reaper app told me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The what?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Soul Reaper app. You know, the app which tells you when, where and how many people are going to die.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOkay, look. I’d seen a lot of weird stuff in my life. I could accept a creepy teenager with a tail in the middle of the night, but I refuse to believe there was an app which told you when you’d die. I’d had it with this kid.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shook my head and turned to go again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It must’ve been hard when the love of your life chose money over you. Did you plan to die here all along, or did your feet just happen to bring you here? You’ve got no idea how many times that happens.” He said, again in that sing-song voice of his.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the second time, I stopped. I whirled around to look at him. He’d put the phone down and was looking at me with a mixture of amusement and excitement in his eyes, like I was a new plaything he was trying to learn the mechanics of.\\r\\n\\r\\n“H-how…”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How did I know you were going to commit suicide and your ex-girlfriend left you? Your profile is updated on the Find A Soul app.” He shook his phone at me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What the hell…”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look for yourself,” he said and threw the phone at me. I wasn’t expecting it, but caught it on reflex – and dropped it immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phone was hot on one side and cold on the other. It was like walking into an air-conditioned room after spending some time in the heat outside. I picked it up hastily, hoping it wasn’t scratched up. It wasn’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at the screen, which had my name and my photo on it. It had all my details, including my birthday, the hospital I was born in, and even the names of the nurses who oversaw my delivery. I scrolled down with shaking fingers, reading my life story. Even the most discreet of things I’d done, stuff I was sure that nobody had any idea about, where spelled out for the world to see. I skimmed through the text, till it stopped on the last line, which said,\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Abandoned by ex-girlfriend, ponders suicide on a bridge…’\\r\\n\\r\\nMy entire body was trembling. I didn’t know how, but I’d gotten myself involved in something supernatural. I looked at the boy, who made a little motion with his hands, like he was calling a puppy. The phone flew from my hands and into his, and he resumed peering into it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI gulped twice and tried to speak, but no words came out. I tried to ask about the app, the tail or what the heck was going on, but the question I dearly wanted to know the answer to sprung to my lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who are you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boy smiled. His cheekbones went back and revealed a set of pearly-white teeth, and he threw his head back, so the moonlight put his jaw in the shadow, and his tail perked up again, sniffing the air like an excited dog.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am Death, pleased to meet you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter almost jumping to my death, seeing a red tail on a boy and reading my life’s history on a Smartphone, you’d thing I couldn’t be gobsmacked anymore, but when this teenager told me he was Death, I literally cocked my head to one side and looked at him quizzically.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you don’t believe me.” He said, in a matter-of-fact tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Actually, now I understand why you have a tail,” I said, trying to sound brave, when actually my insides were quivering like jelly. “And I guess the phone is like your modern-day Death Note?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe brightened immediately and nodded. “That’s right! Now that’s one anime which got stuff right, even if they did take some liberties. I don’t have to actually write my victim’s names here, you know. I get their details, and I go to reap souls. That’s why I’m here right now,” he said, and gave me a toothy grin.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe moved closer to me, tapping on the screen as he walked, and held the phone in front of my face.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at the screen. It was a different colour now, black and red, and it said Soul Reaper on the top. I guessed this was the app he was talking about before.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the middle of the screen, one line kept flashing – Two, Under Stepston Bridge, Midnight.\\r\\n\\r\\n“See?” he said, smiling genially. “It says there’ll be two deaths under Stepston Bridge – this bridge, that is – at midnight, which is…” he consulted his watch, which was also black and red, with horns drawn into the dial, “about 16 minutes from now.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI gulped, as I stared at my literal death warrant.\\r\\n\\r\\n“S-so… that’s supposed to mean…”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You, yes,” he said and grinned again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“B-but it says two deaths,” I said, trying to put forward what I thought was a good point.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I know,” he said and shrugged. “I suppose the second victim will come along shortly, the app never lies you know.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI gulped again as my forehead felt wet with perspiration. I managed to find my voice again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“S-so… You really are…”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Death, with a capital D, yes.” He said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So even if I jump now, I’m not going to die until midnight?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe nodded again and leaned against the railing once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve looked into your records, and you’ve been a good man for most of your life, so I decided to give you a little heads-up. You can jump right now, but you’ll lie in a pool of your own blood, unable to scream from a crushed throat, looking at your own smashed brain and generally experience excruciating pain till midnight, which is when you’ll eventually snuff it. I thought you deserved a warning, and I had some free time, so here I am,” he said, with the air of one talking about the weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nA swirl of questions exploded inside in my mind with so much force that my head actually started to hurt. I opened my mouth to ask him more, especially about what death would bring, and what was next.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I didn’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn’t know why, but some small part of my mind told me some things were left best unanswered. I looked at his face and saw him peering intently into mine, a small smile playing at his lips. Without meaning to, I blushed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So,” I said, casting my mind around to talk about something, because I really hate awkward silences.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mh-hmm,” he said, burying his face in the screen. Suddenly, he looked up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you know I reaped a couple of souls at midnight under this bridge last year as well?” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stared at him, not prepared for a question like that. Apparently, it was rhetorical, for he continued.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A pair of drunk motorcyclists rammed into a couple just up there.” He pointed at a spot ahead the bridge. “Rammed the couple straight against the railing and crushed them. See that twisted railing over there with the carved dove missing? That’s where it happened.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe scratched his chin as he pointed to an old and warped railing, about thirty metres from us. It definitely looked all scraped up, like something heavy had pounded into it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yep, I reaped their souls myself. The boy was hardly older than you. The motorcyclists escaped, by the way, they were never seen again.” He said, and seemed deep in thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n“8 minutes to go, by the way,” he said, looking at his watch again. He got off the railing and stretched, looking almost bored.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Aren’t you going to ask me anything?” He said, doing some toe-touches.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well… Do you usually appear before people like this?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the guise of a boy, you mean? No, I vary it. Sometimes I’m an older man, or a black dog, I was even a raging fire once, now that was fun…”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Er, no. Do you often warn people they’re going to die?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boy – Death – raised an eyebrow. He swayed his head from side to side and considered it for a minute.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hm, I do believe this is my first time. Funny how that happens isn’t it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why did you do it for me?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI expected him to look me in the eye and tell me how I was central in the grand scheme of things and how I would be the key piece in an event that would change history as we would know it.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, he shrugged and said, ‘I was bored.’\\r\\n\\r\\nI sighed. So my brief appointment with death was a mere window for Death to have some fun and entertain himself. Even in death, I was merely a source of time pass.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ran my hands through my hair and looked at Death. He was smiling that creepy smile again, his face hungrily boring into mine. I sighed again. My life had been one big joke, and now it looks like my death would be the same.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Okay, one final question, and this is just because I’m curious, mind,” I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fire away. Five minutes left,”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now you’ve told me that I’ll die at midnight, what happens if I just walk away now? Does it mean I cheat death?”\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath stopped smiling. The air froze, and I suddenly started to shiver. Drops of sweat trickled down my back as Death fixed his eyes on mine.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh no, you never cheat death. Or Death, for that matter, don’t worry about that. Death is cold, calculating, final and inevitable. Death will come for you when you least expect it, oh yes. If you’ve got an appointment with Death, you keep it, or else…”\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath hadn’t frowned or even sounded angry, but his words cut through the air like a knife. Each syllable resonated in my ears as for the first time that night, I felt afraid.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’d had enough. I was going to die, and that was that. I gripped the railing so hard that my hand hurt. I glanced at the big clock in the city – it showed 4 minutes to midnight. Heck, I’d suffered all this long, what’s four more minutes?\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce again, I swung a leg over the railing. Death looked at me with a strange expression in his eyes. It was something hovering between curiosity… and was that pity?\\r\\n\\r\\nI swallowed and looked up at the night stars. They were beautiful. I took a breath and prepared to hoist my foot off the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s when I heard the scream.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was more like that start of a scream, and then it was abruptly cut off.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stopped and turned to my left, where the scream had come from. In the dim light of the streetlight, I could barely make out some people against the side of the bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nI slowly stepped back on to the road and peered closer. Beside me, Death had tucked his phone back into his pockets and was watching with an interested expression on his face. I moved a little closer, and the full sight of what was happening hit me like a truck.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo men were holding a woman against the side of the railing. One of them was holding her mouth shut while the other was looking left and right, scanning the surroundings. Either he was totally blind that he missed both me and Death, or he was so tensed he looked past us that he turned to his partner and nodded. The woman was visibly struggling under the other man’s grip as she flailed out with thin arms which made no impact.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why didn’t he see us?” I asked in a low voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I believe you’re standing in a bit of a blind spot. As for me, I chose to be invisible to them. Also, to answer your earlier question, I believe the second victim has arrived.” Said Death, nodding at the woman who was slipping lower and lower down the railing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“H-Her? W-what do you mean? Go stop them! Do something!” I said, gesticulating at the men. The one who was holding the girl slapped her hard. It echoed like a gunshot across the bridge, and she slumped down, unconscious.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath raised an eyebrow. “Why? I’m Death, remember? I’ve got souls to reap. And you’ve got three minutes to go, by the way.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI stared at him, wide-eyed. Ahead of me, both men were giving each other malevolent grins as the first one stepped back from the second. With a sickening realisation, I knew what fate awaited her.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ran forward, nearly tripping on my feet as I launched myself towards the two men.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath was right. I had been in a blind spot, because neither of them saw me until I was practically on top of them. I pushed the one who standing out of the way, and before he could react, clamped my arms around the first one’s neck, holding him in a half-nelson. I smelled the alcohol on his sour breath, and felt my head spin as it made its way through my nose.\\r\\n\\r\\nI pulled him to his feet as he struggled in front of me, making choking and gurgling sounds. I drove a knee into his back and he arched back. I tightened my grip and his attempts at fighting back was getting slower, his movements more laboured, no doubt a side-effect of the drinks he had consumed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was wresting the initiative from him. There was probably two minutes to go before I died and Death reaped my soul. Saving this girl would be the last thing I would ever do.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was when the second guy kicked my side. My grip on the first man loosened as I slammed into the railing, lights flashing before my eyes. I barely had time to cover my head before a shower of kicks came flying at me. I closed my eyes and winced as a heavy boot pummelled my arms and head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Got you, did he?” asked the second men.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first one had finished coughing and was looking at me with murder in his eyes. “Right well, he did. I say we finish him off before we start on the girl.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second man nodded and kicked me in the gut again. I rolled forward, holding my stomach and moaning in pain. He placed a boot on my neck and began to squeeze. Lights popped in my head and my throat started to constrict. My headache got worse till my head felt like it was about to burst open. I tried to prise the leg off my neck, but it was too strong.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the life ebbed away from me, I suddenly felt a tear slip down my cheek.\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn’t understand. I was ready for this for a long time. I was ready to leave everything behind in a world that had used me and given nothing back. I was ready to go on the next great adventure, ready to be a stain on the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen why was I crying?\\r\\n\\r\\nI opened my eyes and the answer came to me. I looked at the face of the unconscious woman. She was beautiful, in a sort of ethereal way. She didn’t deserve this fate. She deserved a full, happy life, with someone who could give it to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was like a switch had flicked on in my head.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was the one who was prepared to die, not her. She didn’t deserve to be the second victim tonight.\\r\\n\\r\\nA surge of strength poured through me as I lifted the boot off my neck with both arms. The man stumbled and backed away. I sprang to my feet and faced them. Both of them lunged towards me and grabbed me by the scruff of the collar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next few seconds happened in a flash. I remember grabbing both of their necks. Somehow, we’d all turned around so that they were with their backs to the railing. Their eyes raged in a frenzy as they both tried to strangle me.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I was stronger. I had decided to fight for another.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mind became blank as I did the first thing that came to my mind. I pushed with all my strength.\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt their grips loosen as both men fell backward, stumbled, and crashed into the railing.\\r\\n\\r\\nI only had a split-second view of the railing which they had slammed into. It was an old, twisted one, with a dove missing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith an almighty crash, the entire section of the railing gave way and both men disappeared from sight. A second later, I heard a sickening noise as they splattered on the ground underneath.\\r\\n\\r\\nFar away, the big clock in the middle of the city struck midnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nI slumped to the ground, shell-shocked at what had happened. My entire body trembled as I replayed the last minute in my head.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom my left, a voice called out,\\r\\n\\r\\n“Top stuff, very good.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI raised my head. Death was standing over me, a satisfied expression on his face. He took his phone out from his pocket, and as I watched, two small wisps of smoke zoomed out from under the bridge and went inside the phone. He nodded and put the phone back into his pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n“W-What…”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, those were their souls. I was promised two souls at midnight you see, and it seems I’ve collected my due.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“B-but you said you wanted my…”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your soul? Come now, don’t flatter yourself. I don’t recall saying that. I simply said two people would die here at midnight.” He pointed down the bridge where the bodies of the two men undoubtedly lay. “And they have. My job here is complete.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“S-so, I’m not going to die?” I managed to stutter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, the Soul Reaper app says the next death will happen another 500 miles from here in about 3 minutes. So unless you can travel that far, I’d say no.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy shoulders slumped. I began to tremble again, and this time, I realised that it was a different sort of tremble. I was laughing, actually laughing, and what more, I was literally laughing in the face of Death.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath smiled again and turned his back on me, no doubt to go to his next location of death.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tell me the truth,” I said. He stopped in his tracks.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why did you appear in front of me the way you did? Why did you stop me from jumping?”\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath didn’t turn around for a few seconds, and for a fleeting moment, I wondered if I’d crossed a line. Then, he half-glanced at me and spoke,\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you remember the accident I told you about? How two drunk motorcyclists killed a couple over here?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI nodded slowly. The girl near my feet was stirring.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, what if I told you the two men who died today were the same men who ran over the couple?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI stared at Death, thunderstruck.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What goes around doesn’t always come around, remember that. So every once in a while, I give it a little push, to keep the balance, to keep things from going haywire.” He turned around fully now and looked me in the eye. For the first time that night, I saw a bit of sadness in his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe clapped his hands, making me jump.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right then. I’m late for my next appointment. Last year, a couple was killed, and two men walked free. Today, two men were killed, and you two remain.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe pointed at me and the girl. “So be a good boy and take a hint, okay?” He made a kind of motion with his hands like he was telling us to hug.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Seriously? I barely know her!” The girl was emitting a small moan, and her eyelids were slowly fluttering.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, you’ve got to start somewhere, right? Here’s a piece of advice, keep it simple.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI rolled my eyes. “You’re Death. You’re supposed to be spreading suffering, not love.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce again, Death threw back his head and grinned. It was the most horrible thing I’d ever seen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who says they are so different from one another?” he said in a rich tone.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe started to shimmer, getting fainter by the second.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A parting word – Don’t die before you live. I look forward to the day I reap your soul.” He said, as his tail coiled around him, before vanishing entirely.\\r\\n\\r\\nI barely had a second to catch my breath before the girl at my feet shot awake and started looking around her like a feral animal. Her hands were closed into fists and she faced this way and that in abject terror. Finally, she noticed me and sprang back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“W-who…”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s fine. The men are gone. You’re okay now.” I said, holding up both hands in a placating gesture.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gone? W-where did they go?” She turned back and tried to look down the bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nI acted quickly. No point in having her see two dead bodies. I cupped my hand under her chin and made her face me. I drew closer, and looked her in the eye.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s safe,” I said, not breaking eye-contact. She had beautiful eyes, like two pools of black water.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll protect you,” I said, and meant it. She blushed and nodded. At second later, I felt like kicking myself for saying a stupid thing like that.\\r\\n\\r\\nI got up and offered a hand. She took it and I helped her up. I offered to walk her home, and she agreed. We walked wordlessly, side by side, down the empty bridge. I didn’t let go of her hand the entire time.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath was right. You didn’t die before you lived.\\r\\n\\r\\nI tried to die once, and it didn’t quite appeal to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I was ready to live.\\r\\n\\r\\n–END–\",\n    \"story_image\": \"http://mapi.trycatchtech.com/uploads/stories/e83d5c3bb0fc3eeb5fc63fbfd31ac25a.jpg\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"post_id\": \"63\",\n    \"category_id\": \"9\",\n    \"post_name\": \"The Piggy Back Ride\",\n    cover: book3img,\n    \"post_desc\": \"A married couple fought a great deal and finally began talking about getting a divorce.

Before long the old problems resurfaced and the father and mother were fighting all the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night, when the boy was about 5 years old, the couple put the boy to bed and then got into an enormous fight. In a fit of rage, the father put his hands around his wife’s neck and choked the life out of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nEventually, when he realised what he had done, he began to panic. He knew he had to get rid of the body if he wasn’t going to get caught.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bundled the body into the boot of his car and drove out of town to a swamp. He took the body from the car, but rigor mortis had started to set in and it was difficult to carry it.

He let her go and watched the stiff hands and wretched face recede into the murky swamp water.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man went home, and got in the shower to clean up, but he couldn’t get rid of the foul stench of the swamp.

The following story has been presented as “true” by many past storytellers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time, there was a 10 year old girl who lived in London in a very old house. She hated the house. It was cold and damp all of the time. Plus, none of her friends would visit because it was believed by everyone in the neighbourhood that a ghost lived in the house. The little girl was curious about the ghost, but nobody would talk to her when she asked questions about it or the history of the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house was scary, and some nights were worse than others. One night, when she was in her room reading, the lamp suddenly went off. She thought the light bulb had died. She did not want to bother her mother, who was already sleeping, by asking for a new bulb. So she put down her book and prepared to sleep. All of a sudden, there was a quiet knocking on the window next to her bed. She saw the reflection of a boy, about her age, reflected on the window glass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl turned to look in her room, but saw nothing. She got out of bed and went over to her lamp. She felt something wet on the ground. She flicked on the lamp, which now worked, and saw a red stain where she was standing. Then it disappeared. It wasn’t blood, because the red was too bright, almost pink, like paint. She scratched at the purple wall of her room and, believe it or not, behind the purple paint was pink, the same dark shade that had been on the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl ran out of her room toward her parent’s room. But then she saw something that made her open her mouth to scream, though no sound came out. The attic door was right above her staircase, really high up; only her dad could reach it. Hanging from it was a noose, the thing they hung people on.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl ran back to her room and there was a body in her bed. She grabbed her phone to take a picture. She wanted proof. She wanted to know in the morning if what she saw was a dream or real. She took a picture of her bed, and, without looking at it, ran to get her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrumpily, her mother came up the stairs. The girl pointed to where the noose had been, but now it was just a piece of string from her mother’s sewing kit. She led her mother up to her room, to show her the child’s body, but now there was nothing. As her mother turned to leave the room, the girl remembered the camera. She grabbed it and turned it on, showing it to her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no longer a photo of her bed.

The older boy turned his head to the wall and began to count. He could hear his little brother’s feet as he scampered about looking for a place to hide.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ready or not I’m coming,” cried the older brother and off he went looking for his brother. He looked in all the usual places, behind the sofa, in the bathroom behind the shower curtain, behind the curtains in every room, and under all the beds, but he couldn’t find him. The apartment was eerily silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he heard a scraping sound coming from the wardrobe. The boy was sure he’d already looked there, but he went anyway and called out, “Come out I’ve found you!” but there was only silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain he called for his brother to come out and again nothing. Opening the door, the boy tried to peer behind the wall of dresses and coats hanging there. He bent down, but he did not see any feet standing there. He began to rise up and put his hand out into the mass of clothing to feel for his little brother when a small, white, icy cold hand came out, grabbed his wrist, and tried to pull him into the closet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he is trying to pull himself free, he hears a noise behind him, looks over his shoulder, and sees his brother behind him. “Couldn’t you find me?” asks the boy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe older brother screams in fright and desperately tries to free himself from the grip of the hand, all the while being pulled into the wardrobe.

We enjoyed the ride and each every moment is still cherished. Our ancestral house was situated a little away from the small town and each house stood in hectares of land unlike the ones we stayed in the city. Our village days began with early morning prayers. During the day Nandu and I along with the village children played a lot of “desi games” the ones which were found only in the villages, ate ghee sweets prepared by grandmother, enjoyed the milk from Nandini our cow, climbed trees, went hiking, etc. At night our grandmother made sure that we went early to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe enjoyed each and every corner of the village. The village seemed to have something that the city lacked. But there was one such place that the elders prohibited us from visiting. And that was the little green house that stood in the corner of the lane. The house was quite pretty from outside. There was a beautiful garden with a path paved from the gate to the entrance of the house. Though the house looked quite old it looked beautiful. We kids wanted to explore the place. But we never ever were given a chance to. Stories revolved that the house was haunted by a lady who had been murdered. The ghost was seen by some elders in the village. The underlying mystery was unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne Sunday evening with the permission of our grandmother, Nandu and I along with the village children visited the temple fair in our village. We promised our grandmother that we will be back before the dusk had set in. And as to our word Nandu and I walked back to our house while the other children returned to theirs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night had started to set in. The trees were creaky and the owls flew among them. We walked through the lane. The green house could be viewed at a distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly Nandu said, “ Didi can we go to the green house?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“But Nandu granny will be furious with us.” I replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Nandu had made up his mind. He was slowly pulling my hands and before I could make out we had entered the compound of the house. The house looked a little dirtier than we could we see from outside the compound. Dried leaves lay all along the ground. We moved one step at a time to the entrance of the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe pushed the doors of the house and it opened . Nandu and I walked through the dark passage of the house. The lights of the house were broken. Even if they were not electricity was out of question. But the courtyard brought in the silver moonlight into the house. The moonlight led us into a huge room with some broken old furniture.\\r\\n\\r\\n“ Didi do you expect a ghost here?” asked Nandu.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shh….” I had to silence Nandu. I wondered if the ghost stories were true. We moved from room to room. The walls of the room were decorated with huge scary paintings.\\r\\n\\r\\n“ Nandu lets go home. Granny will worry.” I said.\\r\\n\\r\\nNandu reluctantly agreed and soon we walked back to the front door. We tried to open the door but to our dismay the doors would not open. It had got locked from outside.\\r\\n\\r\\n“ Didi what shall we do?” Nandu started to cry.\\r\\n\\r\\n“ Nandu don’t cry let’s see if there is any other way out” I comforted him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe moved through the house trying to find some rear entrance or openings. The rear doors were all locked from outside. I realized we were trapped.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe sat in the passage a little scared. The whole place looked very weird with cobwebs and large scary huge black poisonous spiders. The night passed and midnight arrived. Hoots of some wild animals, cry of cats and all sorts of frightening sounds filled the air. For once I felt that we had lost our lives to some ghosts. I could hear the rain falling heavily outside. I cried silently.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Didi wake up.” I could feel Nandu’s small hands on my face.\\r\\n\\r\\nI opened my eyes. The first rays of sunlight crept through the courtyard ceiling. In the daylight we saw a much prettier ghost house this time less scary than it appeared in the night. The courtyard had a glass ceiling and the sunlight was coming through them. The pictures which seemed scary the previous night looked beautiful and aristocratic. They looked like some modern art and pictures of gods. The house must have belonged to someone who had a deep interest in paintings.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nandu let’s see if we can get out of this place.  Granny would have filed a case at the village police station by now.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe moved through the rooms to see if there were any openings we could not see because of the dark the previous night. The rooms looked much better though it was very dirty.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Didi what is that?” Nandu pointed to a huge chest in the corner. It looked like a treasure chest. The metal on top of the box depicted a devilish face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ghosts live in the dark” whispering these words to myself I opened the chest. We were surprised to see the chest full of antiques, gold, jewellery, precious and semi precious stones and what and all.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hey Didi look granny’s bronze elephant” Nandu shouted.\\r\\n\\r\\nGranny had a bronze elephant with beautiful big tusks which had been stolen by some thieves some years back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nandu this chest contains things stolen from the villagers” I replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe could hear noises outside and soon the front door opened. The village police had arrived to rescue us.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nandu , Lakshmi… …”Granny’s eyes were filled with tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Granny see… your bronze elephant” Nandu was excited.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of us walked out of the house into the village lane. There was a crowd outside but we children walked like heroes from some detective story who had helped the poor villagers to hunt their treasure. The air was filled with gossips of how we children had recovered the lost belongings. It seems there was no ghost that lived in the house and the thieves who had kept the stolen things had spread fear among the villagers. Anyway whatever the truth might be Nandu and I dare not to visit the green house again. That scary dark night ……….\\r\\n\\r\\n__END__\",\n    \"story_image\": \"http://mapi.trycatchtech.com/uploads/stories/b4ae79b721ac0593d88ded50f675cebd.jpg\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"post_id\": \"59\",\n    \"category_id\": \"9\",\n    \"post_name\": \" SIR, I AM THE MURDERER…\",\n    cover: book7img,\n    \"post_desc\": \"“Sir, I am a murderer.” She was trembling while saying this. She was sitting in our police station, opposite to my table. She was there to surrender herself. I was the in charge of the police station.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a beautiful lady of about 22 or 23 years, had long hairs which were maintained really nicely, wearing pink shirt and dark blue jeans, had sunglasses on her eyes. She was looking from a nice and rich family.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who did you killed?” Well I asked her after taking a long pause because her first sentence was not really expected or if I talk frankly, I was lost in her beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have killed 3 people.” I was really surprised to hear that. A girl, so pretty, can kill 3 people and also committing it in front of police. The whole thing was a bit unusual for me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have killed my Gardner, my driver and ……..” She paused a bit and started to sob. “And my mother.” She started crying hard. I gave her water and she started to take sip from that glass.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she controlled her emotions, she continued to talk. “Please I beg of you, please arrest me otherwise I will kill someone else also.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why did you kill them and why will you kill others? Mam………. What’s your name?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shilpa.” She was still sobbing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shilpa, why did you kill them?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know. I just happened automatically.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shilpa, I am not getting it. And I cannot arrest you without any complaint and without seeing the body of the dead people you are talking about.” She was looking very tense to me. So I continued, “Shilpa, where are the bodies?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I dug them in my garden.” She was not looking like fake but what she was saying was even not looks to be believed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI decided to go to her house. I took two constables also with me. When we reached her house she took us to her garden and told us the places where the body of the gardener and driver were dug. I commanded the constables to take the bodies out.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where’s the body of your mother?” I asked Shilpa.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Inside the home.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI started to follow Shilpa. She took me inside the house and then stopped in front of a dark room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Inside. My mother is lying inside.” She started to cry again.\\r\\n\\r\\nI slowly started to move inside the room. The room was so dark that it was difficult to see anything. I had one torch with me so I decided to turn that on. I searched the whole room but the room was empty. Then I saw one room which was closed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI opened that room. And got shocked to see that there were three bodies lying inside the room. Two men may be Shilpa’s gardener and driver and one old lady may be her mother. I was wondering why Shilpa told me that bodies are out there in garden.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ahhhhhh………” Someone stabbed me from behind. I turned around. I was shocked to see Shilpa standing with a knife in her right hand covered with blood of mine.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why?” I asked her in a trembling voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe came closer to me and stabbed in my stomach and said, “Because, it’s fun.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI fell on ground and she took my gun and rushed outside. I heard two fires. She killed my constables also\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw her last image standing in front of mirror, combing her hairs and singing song………….\\r\\n\\r\\n__END__\",\n    \"story_image\": \"http://mapi.trycatchtech.com/uploads/stories/ffabfa0d5c0ba8785bc6607afea94e32.jpg\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"post_id\": \"58\",\n    \"category_id\": \"9\",\n    \"post_name\": \"Mysterious friend\",\n    cover: book8img,\n    \"post_desc\": \"Lakshmi was waiting for her daughter Kavya to return home. Recently Kavya started playing with some unknown kid at the river side. That river is just few yards from their home. She told to her mother as that stranger is her new mysterious friend. Their home is located in the suburb at the edge of a small forest. Kavya’s father Hari is very fond of that home as he had spent most of his childhood days in it. Though it is far from the town, he decided to live in it. There is a two meter wall around the property and one can see a beautiful juicy green grass surrounding to that home.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they moved into that home, Kavya was a year old kid. After Kavya, doctors told, it is difficult for Lakshmi to have another child. So they started taking care of her with utmost care. When Kayva turned five, she had realized that she wanted more friends to play, but beside of her home, there were no other homes so no kids to play with her. She felt very bored. Once in a while they used to go to their friend’s home in town to spend some time with their kids. But for Kavya that was not enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany times Lakshmi asked Hari to move to some other home near to town just for Kavya, so she could find many friends in town, but Hari keeps postponing it. Meanwhile, Kavya got used to play alone and spend a lot of time at the river side.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the days were going like this, one day Kavya had come home happily and told that she got a friend at the river side. Lakshmi was surprised as per as she knows, there were no one living near to their home, so there is no chance for anyone to come there to play. But when Kavya described her like how she talks, how she looks, then she started believing that that girl could be coming from a nearby village. As per her description, she was same age of Kavya and every day she comes by just wearing a kid’s panty. But Lakshmi was curious to know how come such a small girl comes alone from a village.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe asked Kavya to bring her to home. But she refused to bring her as her friend doesn’t like to come to their home. And her friend told to Kavya that no one should see her; otherwise she wouldn’t meet her again. After hearing that, Lakshmi started suspecting her friend. She told to Hari about Kavya’s mysterious friend. But he didn’t care much about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat day Lakshmi decided at any cost she should find who was she? So she prepared Kavya’s favorite sweet to sooth her and find more details about her friend. She was waiting for her to come back to home. After some time, she came.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hi Sweety, you know what I prepared for you. Can you guess?”, she said by carrying her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hey… mummy… I know you prepared Gulab Jamun … I like it”, She was very happy. Lakshmi nodded and took her to the kitchen and gave a Gulab Jamun. While she was eating, she asked, “Sweety, does your friend also like Gulab Jamun ?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, mummy”, she said gulping the Jamun.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy don’t you take this to your friend? She might feel very happy, Ok”, she said by giving a box to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ya, you are right mummy. She feels very happy… you are very nice”, she said by taking that box.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Will you go now? Are your friend still be at the river side “, she asked by looking at her carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ya mummy she stays always there. Even she doesn’t have any friends…, so I go and give it right now”, she said and ready to leave home.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ok, come quickly … and be careful alright”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes… mummy and my friend feels very happy after seeing this sweet… bye”, she said and went outside.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter few seconds, Lakshmi followed her, and she was extremely careful so that Kavya wouldn’t notice her. When she reached the bay, she was stunned after seeing what Kavya was doing at that place. Actually there was no one other than Kavya at that place. She was talking alone and feeding Gulab Jamun in air. She was talking such a way that someone was sitting beside of her. Lakshmi went quickly and stood in front of Kavya and shouted, “Sweety… What are doing alone here?”,\\r\\n\\r\\nKavya looked startled after seeing her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mummy… Why you came? I told you shouldn’t come here… see…my friend left”, she muffled.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shut-up… you don’t have any friends here… you were talking alone here… “, she said in hysteric manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nKavya has never seen her mother before like that. She started crying, “I was talking with my friend only… I was not taking alone… she has left because you came…”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Enough… come home”, she grabbed her hand and took her to home.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they reached home, Kavya was still crying and went inside of her bedroom and closed the door. Lakshmi was terribly upset to see her kid talking alone. She waited for Hari to come home, so that she could share what happened today to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh… that is very common baby… kids sometimes behaves like that… they make friendship with imaginary people… and they talk with them… so don’t make it as a big issue… take it easy”, Hari said to her when she told about what happened that day.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe didn’t expect that answer from him as she thought he would take Kavya to some doctor for check-up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But… honey… it is not good behavior for anyone to talk on their own… so can we have to take her to the hospital?“, She is worried.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I told you … take it easy… it’s not that big problem… alright … I’ve to take a bath”, he said and went to the bathroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Lakshmi was not convinced at all; however she wanted to keep a close eye on her daughter actions. Her worry was doubled when Kavya one day told her that her friend came to her bedroom to talk to her as since after that incident Lakshmi was not allowing Kavya to go to the river side.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What did she tell to you?” she was curious to know.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She is very angry on you mummy as you are not allowing me to talk to her. She told that she would kill you… but I pleaded her not to do that… she is not like before… she is changed so much… I’m afraid mummy”, she is frightened.\\r\\n\\r\\nLakshmi face turned pale and terrified to hear “Killing” word from five years old kid mouth. She hugged her immediately, “nothing is going to happen Sweety… don’t worry … ok”, she tried to sooth her. Inside she thought, why the hell she was talking like that; she strongly determined to take her to the doctor before situation goes out of her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t understand what’s the matter with you… you are not listening my words… we must take her to the doctor… she is behaving like a crazy girl… today she said her imaginary friend is going to kill me… do you wait until she turns to a MAD girl”, Lakshmi was shouting on Hari.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Calm down Lakshmi… nothing is going to happen … just wait for few days everything is going to be alright”, Hari was trying to calm down her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When… when it will happen… you don’t like to change the house…You don’t like to take her to doctor… you don’t like anything to happen… why? I have to know today … that’s it”, she was shouting in a hysteric manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No … we can’t take her to any doctor… because… “, Hari stopped and he didn’t know what else to tell.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because… why??? Why we can’t take her to any doctor??? Now I’m realizing why… because you don’t like her… you don’t have any affection on her… “,\\r\\n\\r\\nHari got angry and crunched his fist, “Shut-up… I didn’t want to take her… because there is NO “HER”… our Sweety is DIED … yes… OUR KID IS DEAD … when we moved here… you took her in a boat on the river… but… that time the boat crashed into tree and flipped. And you both had fallen in the river… you were able to survive, but our Sweety had drowned to death… “, he burst into tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was shocked and looking at him unbelievably.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe continued, “after that incident… you didn’t believe that our kid is no more… you started behaving as if she is still alive and playing with us… you constructed a dream world, where our Sweety lived with us and has grown up… it was you… you didn’t like to change home, because if we move to a different home.. you might recall that Sweety is no more…, but you didn’t want that… you wanted to live in your dream world … and feel our Sweety presence… but you don’t understand… how much torture I had gone through by seeing you like that … “, he stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No… you are telling lies… our Sweety
